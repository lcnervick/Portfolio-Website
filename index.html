            <h2>What is Optometry?</h2>
            <p>Optometry is the medical field involving everything that has to do with your eyes and vision. This includes examination, diagnosis and treatment of the eyes and surrounding structures, and the treatment of vision problems. Common areas of practice include correction and/or treatment for low-vision, near-sightedness and far-sightedness, glaucoma, cataracts, retinal disorders, myopia, color-blindness and systemic diseases.</p>

            <h2>What is an Optometrist?</h2>
            <p>Doctors of Optometry (ODs) are the independent primary health care professionals for the eye. Optometrists examine, diagnose, treat, and manage diseases, injuries, and disorders of the visual system, the eye, and associated structures as well as identify related systemic conditions affecting the eye (American Optometric Association [AOA]).
            <br><em>Note: Optometrists should not be confused with ophthalmologists or dispensing opticians. An ophthalmologist is a physician who also performs eye surgery as well as diagnosing and treating eye conditions. Dispensing opticians fit eyeglasses and contact lenses, following prescriptions written by ophthalmologists or optometrists.</em></p>
